# SimpleRag
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline is an advanced approach in natural language processing that combines retrieval-based and generation-based methods to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses

Here we have loaded the different data from from different sources like text file, pdf file and web url
and converted them to vector embeddings

we have also queried through the embedded documents and got satisfying results.

This is just a simple project to learn how a RAG pipeline works  

here is a example how we queried and got response
